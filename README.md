# Open Zap-It

For those who like to play fictional gun battles between others using self made and really cool
light emitting guns, Zap-It is for you.  The goal of Zap-It is to create a "platform" (yes it's in double quotes)
from which one could build hardware and host games.

## Goals
* Be flexible
* Be simple
* Be fun

## Recommended hardware






# Dependencies
Flatbuffers
sudo apt install -y flatbuffers-compiler
